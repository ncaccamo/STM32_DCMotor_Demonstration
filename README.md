# STM32_DCMotor_Demonstration

This project is practice and demonstrate embedded software skills on a modern ARM microcontroller.

Main objectives:
1. Start a blank project and configure the microcontroller through registers utilizing basic drivers and headers provided by the manufacturer.
2. Drive a DC motor using PWM. Utilize timers.
3. Control the motor speed using a rotary encoder. Change the motor direction with the encoder's pushbutton. Utilize interrupts.
4. Measure the motor speed using a quadrature encoder on the motor.
5. Show the motor speed on a small display. Utilize third party API to drive the display.
